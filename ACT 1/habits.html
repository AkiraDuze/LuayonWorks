				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Sleeping Early and Getting Adequate Sleep</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> I want to make sure I get enough rest each night. By sleeping early, I can get at least 7-8 hours of sleep, which will help me stay alert and focused during the day. Adequate sleep is essential for memory retention, better concentration, and overall mental and physical health. I need to prioritize my rest so that I can perform my best in school. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Staying Organized</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> I plan to create a study schedule and keep all my materials organized. This will help me stay on top of assignments, reduce last-minute stress, and ensure that I have enough time to review before exams. Staying organized will also make it easier to find my notes and study materials when I need them.
				</p>

				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Setting Specific Goals</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> I want to set clear academic and personal goals for myself. By breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable goals, I will be able to track my progress and stay motivated. Having a sense of purpose will help me stay focused and avoid procrastination.
				</p>

				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Studying Consistently</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> Instead of cramming for exams, I want to make studying a consistent habit. By reviewing my lessons daily or weekly, I will avoid feeling overwhelmed during exam periods and retain more information over time. Consistent studying will also help me grasp difficult concepts and improve my academic performance. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Staying Active</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> I plan to incorporate regular physical activity into my routine. Exercise helps reduce stress, increases energy levels, and improves focus. Whether it's going for a walk, doing yoga, or engaging in sports, staying active will benefit both my body and mind, helping me stay healthy and energized throughout the school year.
				</p>

				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Avoiding Multitasking</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> I want to focus on one task at a time to improve the quality of my work. Multitasking often leads to mistakes and decreases efficiency. By giving my full attention to a single task, I will be able to complete it more effectively and with better results.
				</p>

				<p>
					<li>
						<b>Seeking Help When Needed</b>
					</li>
						<i>Reason: </i> If I encounter challenges or struggle with a subject, I will make it a habit to ask for help sooner rather than later. Whether it's from a teacher, classmate, or tutor, seeking help will prevent me from falling behind and give me a deeper understanding of the material.
